  BookTitle: War Never Changes
  BookDescription: War, War never changes. \n\nThe only thing that changes is the
    tech people use to destroy each other. Thats why Tech Boy ascended to power so
    fast, thats why governments are funding every project he's doing. All I'm hoping
    for is that he understands the fallout of each war he creates tech for.
